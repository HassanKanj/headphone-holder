# Headphone holder (3D files)

Here’s a custom headphone holder I designed that you can attach to your desk.

This repo contains the design that I used but I have also included the design file (FreeCAD file) so you can modify the dimensions to suit your needs.

On a side note, I already have a FreeCAD course (in Arabic) on YouTube if you want to learn how to 3D design using the open source program FreeCAD, and here’s the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH1UzPbO2F4&list=PL-pfG3NLl5jY2lb_iF0CPEH7DVZws4aDY

The 3D printed design can be be attached to the desk using a nut and a bolt with a 5mm diameter (in my case I used M5 x 20mm bolt)
